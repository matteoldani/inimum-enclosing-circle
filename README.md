# minimum-enclosing-circle
Minimum Enclosing Circle solver written in c

The program has implemented two functios:

1) BruteForceMethod which is a bruteforce aproach to the problem. The function complexity is around O(n^4)
2) RandomIncrementalMethod wich is a incremental aproach to the problem. The function has a complexity of O(n)
